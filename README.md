# LWIM_Control_System
Open source control software platform for 6-axis manipulator

The Light-weight industrial robotic arm is originally meant for SMEs, where the the tasks change on a regular basis and the company cannot afford to have a long down-time. So the requirements of the software is that it should be easily programmable by intutive ways like joystick, speech commands and teaching by hand. 

Here's a video showing the different modules of the software and finally everything comes together in a vision-based pick-and-place application.

The software was made open-sourced as a research platform for technical institutes, where they could use the robotic arm and the control software to build applications on. Here's one such research project achieved with this platform.
